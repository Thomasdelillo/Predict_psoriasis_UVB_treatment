# Predicting Psoriasis UVB Phototherapy Treatment Outcomes

  **Introduction**
- Psoriasis is a skin disease that leaves the skin red, flaky, and patchy.  UVB phototherapy treatment can reduce symptoms greatly, but there are no clinical approaches to estimate its success before starting treatment.  This means the general course of treatment usually commences with a "wait and see" approach, leading patients and practitioners through some uncertainty.
- Machine learning and artificial intelligence can facilitate treatment plans through highly accurate and confident models, where implementation of these algorithms can predict the chances of treatment success through patient baseline measurements and early treatment responses.  
- The goal of these models is to predict how well treatment will work for patients before they start.
